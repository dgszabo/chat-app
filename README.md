Installation, setup, and starting instructions
===============================================

- First, download the app files from this repo in zip or (fork and) clone the repo to your local machinne.

###Server

- In order to run the server. you need to setup a virtual environment. If you have trouble setting up a vistual environment, see https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/flask-fundamentals/introduction-to-flask.
- Next, install the dependencies of the Flask server. While in the root of the server folder in terminal, type:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Afterwards you need to create and setup the database. To create the database, while in the root of the server folder in terminal, type:
```sh
createdb chat-app
flask db upgrade
```

- To populate the database with data from a seed file for demonstrational purposes (this step may be skipped, but should not be done after using the app, because seeding should only be done using a clean, freshly created database), while in the root of the server folder in terminal, type:
```sh
psql chat-app < data.sql
```

- Finally, to start server, while in the root of the server folder in terminal, type:
```sh
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

After starting the react app you can connect to it at localhost:3000 from any browser window, even multiple browser windows at a time.

Enjoy the app!
